# 1. 启动时加载指定配置文件
  
  启动时需要指定配置文件的路径，命令如下
  ```shell
  ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
  ```
# 2. 配置文件中关于字节单位的约定

  字节单位有K、M、G，对于参数需要以此为单位时，有1000与1024的区别，所以Redis做了如下约定：

  字母大小写不敏感；

  |示例|代表含义|
  |:-:|:-:|
  |1k|1000字节|
  |1k|1024字节|
  |1m|1000000字节|
  |1mb|1024*1024字节|
  |1g|1000\*1000\*1000字节|
  |1gb|1024\*1024\*1024字节|

# 3. 各个参数作用说明

## 3.1 `include`

  示例：
  ```shell
  include /path/to/other.conf
  ```
  用于引用其他配置文件。该参数特别适合如下场景： 针对一个Redis集群有一个通用配置文件，但是针对每个Redis节点又有一些定制化的参数，此时就可以使用本参数。将定制化参数放置于一个单独配置文件，在通用配置文件模板里加以`include`引用。

  注意：Redis解析配置文件里各个参数是有先后顺序，使用覆盖逻辑，即如有相同参数则该参数以最后的数据为准。

## 3.2 `loadmodule`

  示例：
  ```shell
  loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so
  loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so
  ```

  指定Redis启动时的加载so功能模块。
  
  注意：如果模块加载失败，则Redis中止启动。另外可同时配置多个加载模块。

## 3.3 `bind`

  示例：
  ```shell
  bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
  ```

  指定Redis本机监听IP地址，只接收IP目的地为此值的数据包。如未使用bind参数，则Redis默认绑定本机所有网卡配置的IP地址。`bind`参数可以设定多个IP，支持IPv4、IPv6，各个IP之间以空格分割。
  
  注意：禁止直接`bind`公网IP地址，避免将Redis服务直接暴露至公网造成数据泄露。

## 3.4 `protected-mode`

  示例：
  ```shell
  protected-mode yes
  ```

  是否开启`保护模式`，可设置值：yes/no，默认值:yes，即处于开启。

  这里先介绍一下什么是Redis的`保护模式`。
  <br>我们知道Redis里记录的都是业务敏感数据，数据安全至关重要，同时极少有场景需要将Redis集群实例直接暴露至公网。`保护模式`就是Redis的一种自我安全防御措施，Redis会检查是否明确使用`bind`参数绑定监听IP地址，以及是否使用`requirepass`参数配置登陆密码。如果这两个参数均未配置，那么在`保护模式`下，Redis只接收来自于本机`loopback`IP地址的数据包请求 或者 本机`unix domain socket`的请求，即在缺失`bind`与`requirepass`参数情况下，本机之外的服务均无法访问Redis里的数据。

## 3.5 `port`

  实例：
  ```shell
  port 6379
  ```

  指定Redis进程的监听端口号，默认值:6379。

  注意：当指定监听端口号为0时，则Redis不开启TCP监听功能，用户只能通过`unix domain socket`方式访问。

## 3.6 `tcp-backlog`

  实例：
  ```shell
  tcp-backlog 511
  ```

  指定TCP`listen()`时所需的`backlog`数值。
  <br>`backlog`供内核TCP协议栈使用，指定TCP三次握手进行中 或者 握手完毕在等待`accept()`调取的socket队列容量阈值。

  注意：对于高访问量的后端服务，需要设定较高的`backlog`数值。另外在Linux平台下，`backlog`数值不能超过内核`/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn`设定的数值，否则内核会静默式将`backlog`截为`/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn`。为确保`backlog`参数生效，还请同步确认`/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn`数值与`tcp_max_syn_backlog`数值。

## 3.7 `unixsocket`

    实例：
  ```shell
  unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
  ```
 
  指定Redis的Unix域套接字监听地址。

## 3.8 `unixsocketperm`

  实例：
  ```shell
  unixsocketperm 700
  ```

  指定Redis的Unix域套接字对应文件的权限。该参数需与`unixsocket`配套使用。

## 3.9 `timeout`

  实例：
  ```shell
  timeout 0
  ```

  指定访问Redis的client连接的超时阈值，单位：秒。

  注意：当设置为0时，表示用不超时。另外，此值只会影响非阻塞式命令的超时判断逻辑; 而阻塞式命令（如BLPOP等）的超时时长由命令里的超时数值决定。


## 3.10 `tcp-keepalive`

  实例：
  ```shell
  tcp-keepalive 300
  ```
  
  使用SO_KEEPALIVE属性主动侦测TCP死链（对端崩溃or断电）的时长。
  <br>此值为影响启动侦测以及侦测间隔，如值为300时，表示连接空闲300s开始侦测，间隔100s共发送3次，如依旧无响应，则判定超时并关闭TCP套接字。

  注意：当设置为0时，不启用主动侦测TCP死链机制。

## `daemonize`

  实例：
  ```shell
  daemonize no
  ```

  指定Redis进程是否开启后台守护化。可设置值：`yes`/`no`，默认值:`yes`，即处于开启。
  <br> 开启守护化时，进程pid号会保存到`/var/run/redis.pid`文件里，此时的进程无控制终端，标准输入、输出、错误均会被重定向到`/dev/null`中。

## `supervised`

  实例：
  ```shell
  supervised no
  ```

  当通过`upstart`或者`systemd`运行Redis时，是否开启与监控交互功能。

  |参数值|功能说明|
  |:-:|:-:|
  |no|无监控交互|
  |upstart|通过发送`SIGSTOP`信号来通知`upstart`|
  |systemd|通过向`$NOTIFY_SOCKET`写入`READY=1`来通知`systemd`|
  |auto|通过是否设置了`UPSTART_JOB`或者`NOTIFY_SOCKET`环境变量来决定选项为`upstart`或者`systemd`|

## `pidfile`

  ```shell
  pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid
  ```

  保存Redis进程pid的文件路径，进程启动时创建该文件，而在正常退出时会自动删除该文件。

  注意：即使该文件创建失败，也不会影响Redis启动过程。
  <br>之前`daemonize`参数也会影响是否在磁盘上创建保存pid的文件，只不过`daemonize`对应固定路径`/var/run/redis.pid`，而`pidfile`可自定义路径。两个参数之间的影响如下：

  ||`daemonize`开启|`daemonize`关闭|
  |:-:|:-:|:-:|
  |`pidfile`设置|两者都创建各自文件|只有`pidfile`创建自定义路径文件|
  |`pidfile`未设置|只有`daemonize`创建固定路径文件|两者都不创建文件|

## `loglevel`

  ```shell
  loglevel notice
  ```

  指定日志级别，默认notice

  |数值|级别|说明|
  |:-:|:-:|:-:|
  |debug|调试级别|全量日志，用于开发与测试使用|
  |verbose|详细级别|辅助信息|
  |notice|通知级别|关键节点信息，生产环境设为此值|
  |warning|警告级别|重要/错误信息|

## `logfile`

  ```shell
  logfile ""
  ```

  指定日志文件路径。

  注意：为空时，日志信息会打印到标准输出，如果此时`daemonize`开启守护化，则日志会被重定向`/dev/null`中。

## `databases`

  示例：
  ```shell
  databases 16
  ```

  指定Redis进程支持的最多DB库个数。

  注意：在`cluster`模式下，Redis进程只有一个DB库。

## `always-show-logo`

  示例：
  ```shell
  always-show-logo yes
  ```

  是否强制展示Redis logo, 可设置值：`yes`/`no`，默认值:`yes`，即处于开启。

  注意：当置为`no`时，在如下情况下才会展示Redis logo：日志输出到标准输出 且 标准输出到TTY。

```
# 此值为no时,则会判定log file is stdout AND stdout is a tty AND syslog logging is disabled才会显示

# To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes,
# and optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs.
# syslog-enabled no

# Specify the syslog identity.
# syslog-ident redis

# Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.
# syslog-facility local0
```


## `save`

  示例：
  ```shell
  save ""

  save 900 1
  save 300 10
  save 60 10000
  ```

  数据持久化RDB格式的触发条件。
  <br>参数格式为： change_number second_period。表示在`second_period`时间内有`change_number`次数以上改动时，自动开启RDB文件持久化任务。

  注意：参数中的计时周期`second_period`是以上一次成功生成RDB文件为起点计时。
  <br>在上一次RDB保存成功的情况下，满足`任意一个`触发条件即自动开启RDB持久化任务。
  <br>在上一次RDB保存失败情况下，还需满足前后间隔5秒以上，才能检查触发条件以确认是否开启RDB持久化任务。
  <br>如果要关闭RDB持久化，可以设置为`save ""`

## `stop-writes-on-bgsave-error`

  示例：
  ```shell
  stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes
  ```

  在后台RDB持久化任务出错后，Redis是否停止执行用户的写命令。当然在后台RDB持久化成功后，Redis自动恢复正常处理用户的各项命令。

## `rdbcompression`

  示例：
  ```shell
  rdbcompression yes
  ```

  在RDB持久化过程中，是否开启字符型数据压缩。压缩算法为LZY，会牺牲少量CPU以换取RDB文件磁盘空间最少化。

## `rdbchecksum`

  示例：
  ```shell
  rdbchecksum yes
  ```

  在RDB持久化过程中，是否开启文件校验机制（CRC64校验）。
  <br>RDB格式规定，在文件的末尾留有8个字节空间存储校验码。如果开启校验机制，那么RDB文件的生成过程中以CRC64校验码填充末尾的8个字节，并在加载时进行数据校验。如果关闭，则生成RDB文件时以0设置校验码，加载时不予校验。

## `dbfilename`

  示例：
  ```shell
  dbfilename dump.rdb
  ```

  设置RDB文件名称。

  注意：该配置参数只能设置RDB文件名称，名称中不可包含路径。而保存路径由单独参数`dir`设置。

## `dir`

  示例：
  ```shell
  dir ./
  ```

  设置Redis的工作目录。
  
  注意：RDB文件与AOF文件均会保存在此目录下。

## `replicaof`

  示例：
  ```shell
  replicaof <masterip> <masterport>
  ```

  设置当前Redis服务对应的主节点IP与端口号地址。

  注意：此配置表明当前Redis节点是备节点。

```
################################# REPLICATION #################################

# Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#   |      Master      | ---> |    Replica    |
#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of replicas.
# 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# 当前备节点对应的主节点ip 端口号地址
# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>

# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the replica request.
#
# 如果redis主节点设置了密码,则当前的备节点需要将此密码设置在如下参数,以便于当前备节点连接主节点
# masterauth <master-password>

# When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO, replicaOF, AUTH, PING, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG,
#    SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB,
#    COMMAND, POST, HOST: and LATENCY.
#
# 当备节点与主节点的连接断开,当前节点对于客户请求该如何应对
# yes 表示当前备节点可以继续响应用户的请求,但是数据可能是过时的数据
# no 表示当前备节点除了部分命令之前,均以报错信息回复客户的请求
replica-serve-stale-data yes

# You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.
#
# Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.
# 备节点是否为只读节点
# 备节点可以接收写请求,注意写入备节点的数据是易失性的,因为可能会被主节点的同步数据淹没
replica-read-only yes

# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the replication
# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the replicas.
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the replicas incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
# the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new transfer
# will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple replicas
# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
# 不落盘式的复制数据给备节点
repl-diskless-sync no

# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the replicas.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
# waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# Replicas send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_replica_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
# repl-ping-replica-period 10

# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of replica.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of replicas (data, pings).
# 3) Replica timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-replica-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the replica.
#
# repl-timeout 60

# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the replica socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to replicas. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the replica side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the replica side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and replicas are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
# 主备节点复制时,是否关闭tcp nodelay选项.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# replica data when replicas are disconnected for some time, so that when a replica
# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the replica missed while
# disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the replica can be
# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a replica connected.
#
# repl-backlog-size 1mb

# After a master has no longer connected replicas for some time, the backlog
# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
# need to elapse, starting from the time the last replica disconnected, for
# the backlog buffer to be freed.
#
# Note that replicas never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
# resynchronize" with the replicas: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

# The replica priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote into a
# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
replica-priority 100

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N replicas need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-replicas-to-write 3
# min-replicas-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.

# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a master.
#
# The listed IP and address normally reported by a replica is obtained
# in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may be actually reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.
#
# replica-announce-ip 5.5.5.5
# replica-announce-port 1234
```


## `requirepass`

  示例：
  ```shell
  requirepass foobared
  ```

  设置Redis的登陆密码。在连接上Redis之后，可以使用`auth`命令提交登陆密码，验证之后方可读写Redis数据。

  注意：因Redis每秒可处理150K+次`auth`请求，所以需要保证该密码有较高的复杂度以避免被暴力破解。

## `rename-command`

  示例：
  ```shell
  rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
  ```

  对指定的命令进行重命名。格式是：`rename-command` 原始命令名称 新的名称。

  注意：可以通过此方法将一些关键命令重命名为内部名称，只有特定人员知晓，这样避免外部用户通过接口调用。
  <br>如果要废弃指定命令，可以将其重命名为""空即可。
  <br>需留意，重命名操作会在AOF文件中留痕，以及会同步推送到备节点中。

## `maxclients`

  示例：
  ```shell
  maxclients 10000
  ```

  设置Redis的最大连接数。当某一时刻的client连接数超过此阈值时，在回复'max number of clients reached'消息后关闭此client连接。

  注意：该设置不能超过Linux平台单进程open文件句柄阈值-32， 32是Redis预留的供内部使用文件句柄数。


```
############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################

# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory <bytes>

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -> Remove a random key among the ones with an expire set.
# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
#
# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
# randomized algorithms.
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, Redis will return an error on write
#       operations, when there are no suitable keys for eviction.
#
#       At the date of writing these commands are: set setnx setex append

# The default is:

# maxmemory-policy noeviction

# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. For default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used less recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5

# Starting from Redis 5, by default a replica will ignore its maxmemory setting
# (unless it is promoted to master after a failover or manually). It means
# that the eviction of keys will be just handled by the master, sending the
# DEL commands to the replica as keys evict in the master side.
#
# This behavior ensures that masters and replicas stay consistent, and is usually
# what you want, however if your replica is writable, or you want the replica to have
# a different memory setting, and you are sure all the writes performed to the
# replica are idempotent, then you may change this default (but be sure to understand
# what you are doing).
#
# Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more
# memory than the one set via maxmemory (there are certain buffers that may
# be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory and so
# forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they have enough
# memory to never hit a real out-of-memory condition before the master hits
# the configured maxmemory setting.

############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################

# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking
# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands
# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous
# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed
# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other
# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an
# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for
# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.
#
# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives
# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and
# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands
# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the
# object in the background as fast as possible.
#
# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.
# It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good
# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to
# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.
# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the
# following scenarios:
#
# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,
#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified
#    memory limit.
# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the
#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.
# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may
#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key
#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE
#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command
#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace
#    it with the specified string.
# 4) During replication, when a replica performs a full resynchronization with
#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to
#    load the RDB file just transferred.
#
# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,
# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically
# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK
# was called, using the following configuration directives:

lazyfree-lazy-eviction no
lazyfree-lazy-expire no
lazyfree-lazy-server-del no
replica-lazy-flush no
```


## `appendonly`

  示例：
  ```shell
  appendonly no
  ```

是否开启以AOF格式进行数据持久化功能。

注意：即使关闭AOF持久化功能，用户可以使用`bgrewriteaof`命令触发Redis进行一次AOF文件落地。

## `appendfilename`

  示例：
  ```shell
  appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
  ```

  设置AOF文件名称。

  注意：此参数只能设置AOF文件名称，不可包含路径。文件路径是由`dir`进行设置。

## `appendfsync`

  示例：
  ```shell
  appendfsync everysec
  ```

  设置AOF文件的刷盘策略。开启AOF持久化功能时默认使用`everysec`策略。

  |数值|作用|性能|数据安全|
  |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
  |no|不主动刷盘，全权由内核处理|最高|紧急情况下在Linux下可能会丢失30秒内的操作记录|
  |everysec|每秒主动刷盘|高|紧急情况下会丢失2秒左右的操作记录|
  |always|每次落盘都进行刷盘|最低|3种策略中最安全|


## `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite`

  示例：
  ```shell
  no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no
  ```

  当有后台子进程正在进行RDB or Rewrite-AOF期间，是否暂停主进程里的AOF文件主动刷盘，此配置不受AOF刷盘策略影响。

  注意：只有发现Redis有延迟现象时，才设置为`yes`。一般设置为`no`。因为设置为`yes`开启时，当有子进程后台数据持久化期间，主进程的AOF刷盘策略相当于"appendfsync none"，此时如发生断电等异常，在Linux平台下AOF文件会丢失30秒左右的操作。

## `auto-aof-rewrite-percentage`

  示例：
  ```shell
  auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
  ```

  自动触发Rewrite-AOF的阈值之一：当前AOF文件的大小对比最近一次Rewrite-AOF文件大小的百分比

## `auto-aof-rewrite-min-size`

  示例：
  ```shell
  auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64
  ```

  自动触发Rewrite-AOF的阈值之一：自动进行Rewrite-AOF的最小AOF文件大小，以避免AOF文件很小时频繁进行Rewrite-AOF。


## `aof-load-truncated`

  示例：
  ```shell
  aof-load-truncated yes
  ```

  当Redis加载AOF文件时，如发现最后一条命令不完整时，进程是自动忽略该条命令[yes] 还是 中止运行[no]。

  注意：如果该不完整命令并不是文件中最后一条时，进程中止运行。即本配置参数只对最后一条命令有效。

## `aof-use-rdb-preamble`

  示例：
  ```shell
  aof-use-rdb-preamble yes
  ```
  控制是否开启混合模式的AOF，yes表示开启

  以RDB格式将内存里的快照数据全量保存到新AOF文件中，之后再以AOF格式追加增量命令数据。该混合模式的AOF文件既可以加快的Rewrite-AOF过程与重启速度，又能兼顾数据安全。

## `lua-time-limit`

  示例：
  ```shell
  lua-time-limit 5000
  ```

  设置lua脚本的最大运行时长，单位：毫秒。
  <br>如果发现lua脚本运行时长超过此值，Redis在日志中记录此信息，并且返回出错提示。此值为`0`或者负值表示无运行时长限制。


## `cluster-enabled`

  示例：
  ```shell
  cluster-enabled yes
  ```

  开启Redis `cluster`集群模式。


## `cluster-config-file`

  示例：
  ```shell
  cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf
  ```

  设置`cluster`集群模式对应的集群配置文件名称。
  <br>`cluster`集群对应的配置文件无需手动编辑，该文件是有Redis节点自动创建与更新维护。处于`cluster`模式下的每个Redis节点实例均对应一个独有的配置文件，以确保同机启动多个Redis `cluster`节点实例时不会更新同一份配置文件。


## `cluster-node-timeout`

  实例：
  ```shell
  cluster-node-timeout 15000
  ```

  设置`cluster`集群节点的超时阈值，单位：毫秒。
  <br>集群中的某个节点失联时长超过此值则会被集群认为该节点处于`失败`状态。另外提醒一下，节点内部许多处理逻辑的超时阈值均是基于该值的若干倍。

```
# A replica of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
#
# There is no simple way for a replica to actually have an exact measure of
# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
#
# 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
#
# 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#   (node-timeout * replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period
#
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the replica-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-replica-period of 10 seconds, the
# replica will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#
# A large replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a replica at all.
#
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the replica-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
# cluster-replica-validity-factor 10

# Cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working replicas. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working replicas.
#
# Replicas migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working replicas for their old master. This number
# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a replica
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#
# Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1

# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least an hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes

# This option, when set to yes, prevents replicas from trying to failover its
# master during master failures. However the master can still perform a
# manual failover, if forced to do so.
#
# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
# in the case of a total DC failure.
#
# cluster-replica-no-failover no

# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
# available at http://redis.io web site.

########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################

# In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because
# addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is
# Docker and other containers).
#
# In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static
# configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The
# following two options are used for this scope, and are:
#
# * cluster-announce-ip
# * cluster-announce-port
# * cluster-announce-bus-port
#
# Each instruct the node about its address, client port, and cluster message
# bus port. The information is then published in the header of the bus packets
# so that other nodes will be able to correctly map the address of the node
# publishing the information.
#
# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection
# will be used instead.
#
# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
# 10000 will be used as usually.
#
# Example:
#
# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
# cluster-announce-port 6379
# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
slowlog-max-len 128

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################

# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a Redis instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
latency-monitor-threshold 0

############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at http://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxe, so that the "AKE" string means all the events.
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.
notify-keyspace-events ""

############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64

# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified
# as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.
# For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:
# -5: max size: 64 Kb  <-- not recommended for normal workloads
# -4: max size: 32 Kb  <-- not recommended
# -3: max size: 16 Kb  <-- probably not recommended
# -2: max size: 8 Kb   <-- good
# -1: max size: 4 Kb   <-- good
# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements
# per list node.
# The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),
# but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.
list-max-ziplist-size -2

# Lists may also be compressed.
# Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of
# the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list
# are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:
# 0: disable all list compression
# 1: depth 1 means "don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,
#    going from either the head or tail"
#    So: [head]->node->node->...->node->[tail]
#    [head], [tail] will always be uncompressed; inner nodes will compress.
# 2: [head]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[tail]
#    2 here means: don't compress head or head->next or tail->prev or tail,
#    but compress all nodes between them.
# 3: [head]->[next]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[prev]->[tail]
# etc.
list-compress-depth 0

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed
# of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range
# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in
# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the
# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses
# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to
# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is
# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.
hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000

# Streams macro node max size / items. The stream data structure is a radix
# tree of big nodes that encode multiple items inside. Using this configuration
# it is possible to configure how big a single node can be in bytes, and the
# maximum number of items it may contain before switching to a new node when
# appending new stream entries. If any of the following settings are set to
# zero, the limit is ignored, so for instance it is possible to set just a
# max entires limit by setting max-bytes to 0 and max-entries to the desired
# value.
stream-node-max-bytes 4096
stream-node-max-entries 100

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
# want to free memory asap when possible.
activerehashing yes

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
# replica  -> replica clients
# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and replica clients, since
# subscribers and replicas receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.
client-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0

client-output-buffer-limit pubsub 32mb 8mb 60
```

## `client-query-buffer-limit`

  示例：
  ```shell
  client-query-buffer-limit 1gb
  ```

  设置Redis的接收用户命令的缓冲区容量。超过此数值则会返回错误并断开TCP连接。

  注意：在特殊业务需求下（例如：开启事务下的大数据量提交命令），可调高此数值。


## `hz`

  示例：
  ```shell
  hz 10
  ```

  设置Redis内周期性任务的基础运行频率。默认值：10。
  <br>`hz`的取值区间为[1, 500]。在服务空闲时，数值越高，服务自身消耗的CPU越多。但是在访问频繁时，数值越高，Redis处理周期性任务越积极。只有在要求低延时服务时才会将`hz`设置超过100。

## `dynamic-hz`

  示例：
  ```shell
  dynamic-hz yes
  ```

  是否开启动态调整`hz`。
  <br>通常情况下，Redis周期性任务的运行频率由`hz`参数决定。但是当有过多的client连接时，固定的`hz`数值就有些捉襟见肘。通过开启`dynamic-hz`功能，Redis便会以`hz`数值作为基础频率，根据连接的client个数，适当提升实际运行频率。

## `aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync`

  示例：
  ```shell
  aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync yes
  ```

  在子进程Rewrite-AOF期间，是否开启周期性主动刷盘。
  <br>`yes`表示开启，每写盘32MB数据之后会进行一次刷盘。
  <br>`no`表示关闭，整个Rewrite-AOF期间均不会主动刷盘，完全交由操作系统默认处理。
  建议开启，否则在写文件结束时可能会导致大的延迟。

## `rdb-save-incremental-fsyncc`

  示例：
  ```shell
  rdb-save-incremental-fsyncc yes
  ```

  在子进程RDB期间，是否开启周期性主动刷盘。
  <br>`yes`表示开启，每写盘32MB数据之后会进行一次刷盘。
  <br>`no`表示关闭，整个子进程RDB期间均不会主动刷盘，完全交由操作系统默认处理。
  建议开启，否则在写文件结束时可能会导致大的延迟。



## `lfu-log-factor`

  示例：
  ```shell
  lfu-log-factor 10
  ```

  供数据淘汰的LFU策略调优使用，影响`Morris counter`计数的概率因子。
  <br>此值越大，`Morris counter`计数增长的速度越慢。

  该数值的影响可以参考如下数据：
  ```shell
  # +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
  # | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
  # +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
  # | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
  # +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
  # | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
  # +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
  # | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |
  # +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
  # | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
  # +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
  ```

## `lfu-decay-time`

  示例：
